Importance of this project
The importance of this project is to automate and streamline the process of correcting frame scratches and dirt that are found during the scanning of film. This is important because it allows for more efficient and accurate correction of these issues, which can improve the overall quality of the final product.

The project involves creating a script that can automate several tasks, including assisting in marking shots in the color bay, verifying shots in the file system, and providing producers and editors with the correct files that need to be fixed. By automating these tasks, the project can save a significant amount of time and money compared to having people manually perform these tasks.

Overall, the importance of this project is to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of the process of correcting frame scratches and dirt in film, which can ultimately result in a better final product.
